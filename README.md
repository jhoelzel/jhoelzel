### Hey I am Johannes and I talk to humans and machines!

I grew up with the internet, uploaded my first websites to geocities, was tech-admin of a lot of bulletin boards and have been doing professional code since 2003. After trying to build my first start-up in 2006 I realised that they just wonâ€™t come only because I built it. Therefore, I have a bachelor economical psychology, which helps me immensely with team leadership but also allows me to view the product from multiple perspectives.

Since then I have been freelancing with the exceptions of 6 years where I have been exclusively working with one of germanies biggest conference companies to establish their internal and external tech products as well as their IT department. This was the beginning of leading and hiring diverse international teams for me, therefore kanban, scrum and design thinking are not foreign to me. Some I have even taught to clients, when I wear my consultant hat.

That hat also enables me to train others in what I have learned, makes me easygoing as a person and also not afraid of talking to other departments or clients. Overall I have 7 years of hands on (mid level) CTO experience but never really stoped coding since I was 11. I currently specialise in Golang, Kubernetes and how to best make them work together. I write minimal containers with distroless, build clusters from scratch, know my GitOps (also how to set them up) and currently like to play with the kubernetes api directly through the official go-client or the operator sdk among much more. I believe the kubernetes API is the actual key to multitenant deployments as well as more refined scaling techniques.

I started working when Servers where still mostly dedicated, have lived the revolution of virtual servers, made a short stop at serverless tech and am now invested in the kubernetes ecosystem and its containers. My preferred cloud is AWS, but I have worked on others and also like to tame bare-metal and everything in-between. I love solving difficult issues and do most of my work in development containers.

All this makes me perfect if you are looking for someone with seniority, that is flexible, plays well with others but also likes to get his hands dirty.
