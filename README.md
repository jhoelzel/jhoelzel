<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Johannes</h1>

**I talk to humans and machines and specialize in golang, kubernetes as well as automating everything!**

As consultant and developer I provide services from DevOps to application development and have a history of completing projects on time and in budget. **I currently focus on kubernetes, golang and terraform** but have seen and worked on multiple environments.

I grew up with the internet, uploaded my first websites to geocities, was tech-admin of a lot of bulletin boards and have been doing professional code since 2003. After trying to build my first start-up in 2006 I realized that they just wonâ€™t come only because I built it. Therefore, I have a bachelor economical psychology, which helps me immensely with team leadership and communication but also allows me to view the product from multiple perspectives.
 
**My preferred clouds are Azure and AWS**, but I have worked on others **and** also like to tame **bare-metal** and everything in-between. I love solving difficult issues and have worked on multi cloud deployments before.

All this makes me perfect if you are looking for someone with seniority, that is flexible, plays well with others but also likes to get his hands dirty. If you would like to see what I have been up to, please check the projects section on LinkedIn.

As consultant and developer I provide services from DevOps, Platform engineering or Project leadership to application development  and have a history of completing projects on time and in budget. 

Since 2018 I focus on Kubernetes / GitOps / DevOps / Golang  but have seen and worked on multiple environments since 2003.

I build and consult for kubernetes platforms end to end, from ArgoCD to Zalandos Postgres Operator and have build many clusters from scratch on bare-metal and the cloud.

My preferred clouds are Azure and AWS, but I have worked on others and also really like to tame bare-metal and everything in-between. When I have the chance, I build my kubernetes clusters from scratch and love solving difficult issues like working on multi cloud deployments or ensuring that the highest standards of cyber security are set and enforced.
